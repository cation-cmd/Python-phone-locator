Geolocation Code Using Python and OpenCage


This is a simple geolocator code that contains two Python files.

Two modules; phonenumbers and folium are imported using pip

Then an api key is obtained from OpenCage geocoding api at https://www.opencagedata.com

After running the code, go to your folder where your files are stored, and open the html file in a browser to see the phone location.
